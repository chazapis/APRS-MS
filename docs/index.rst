APRS Messaging Service
======================

The *APRS Messaging Service* provides a familiar, email interface to `APRS <http://www.aprs.org/>`_ messaging, making it compatible with existing email client software and services. It is built upon the `APRS-IS <http://www.aprs-is.net>`_, and utilizes common protocols like `IMAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol>`_ and `SMTP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol>`_. APRS-MS is open source and a running instance is available at ``aprs-ms.net``. `Read more <paper.html>`_

Connect with your email client, using ``mail.aprs-ms.net`` as both the incoming IMAP and outgoing SMTP server.

All code and resources are available at `GitHub <https://github.com/chazapis/APRS-MS>`_.

*The project is currently in an early alpha stage, looking for contributions from developers and feedback from testers.*
